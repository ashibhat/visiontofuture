  <h2>Our Story</h2>
<p> Our founder Mark Smith was an employee of a small organisation for 5 years, when he realised that he hadn't been able to choose the skills got to focus on and develop while he was at the organisation. <br>
  That's when it clicked.<br>
  What if he could start an organisation that helped other organisations work hand-in-hand with their employees to develop career progression plans that benefited both the company and the employee.<br>
And that is how the Vision and Value framework was born. <br>
Vision and Value aims to equip small business owners to retain valuable employees and ensure that staff feel empowered to grow.</p> <br>
